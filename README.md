# Lost

A general-purpose interpreted programming language written in Rust. Guaranteed to be Blazingly Fastâ„¢ :P

# Why the name?

This was inspired by the Lox programming language from [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com) by Robert Nystrom.

For obvious reasons, I cannot name it Lust, hence Lox + Rust = Lost :)

# Usage

To run the Lost REPL, simply execute `cargo run`.

To invoke the compiler on a `.lost` file, pass the file as an argument to the above command, i.e. `cargo run file.lost`.

# Getting started

The syntax is fairly straightforward, and is mostly borrowed from existing languages. Reading the below snippet should suffice to start writing code in Lost.

```rust
fn foo(n) {
    if (n == 0) {
        print("Zero");
        while (n <= 1) {
            print(n);
            n = n + 1;
        }
        return true;
    } else {
        print("Not zero");
        for (let i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            print(i);
        }
        return false;
    }
}

let n = 5; // All numbers are handled as floating point values
let isZero = foo(n);
print(isZero); // false
print(foo(0)); // true

let a; // Uninitialised variables are null by default
print(a); // null

// Classes are slightly different compared to other languages.
// There are no fields in the class declaration, only methods.
// Self-referencing works with the `this` keyword.
class Vehicle {
  fn countWheels() {
    print(this.wheels);
  }
}

let car = Vehicle();
car.wheels = 4;
car.countWheels(); // 4
```
