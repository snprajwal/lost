# Lost

A programming language written in Rust. Guaranteed to be Blazingly Fastâ„¢ :P

# Why the name?

This was inspired by the Lox programming language from [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com) by Robert Nystrom.

Lox + Rust = Lost :)

# Usage

To run the Lost REPL, simply execute `cargo run`.

To invoke the compiler on a `.lost` file, pass the file as an argument to the above command, i.e. `cargo run file.lost`.
